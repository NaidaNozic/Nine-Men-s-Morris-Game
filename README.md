# Nine-Men-s-Morris-Game
Project as part of the "Design Patterns" course at the Graz Technical University

The Nine Men's Morris game is implemented in Python using Pygame!

Key Features:
Undo and Redo: Take control of your gameplay by undoing or redoing moves, offering flexibility and exploration of different tactics.
Save and Load: Save your progress and load it later. The game allows you to resume your matches and continue your strategic journey.
Readable and Maintainable Design: The implementation of design patterns such as Abstract Factory, Decorator, Singleton and State ensures a readable and maintainable software architecture.
